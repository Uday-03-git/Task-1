In the provided code, I have loaded and preprocessed the Medical Appointment No Shows dataset by cleaning the column names, converting date columns to the correct datetime format, and creating a new feature  to calculate the difference between the scheduled and appointment dates. I have handled missing values, removed duplicates, and converted the target variable no_show into a binary format for easier analysis. Additionally, I have generated visualizations such as histograms, count plots, and boxplots to explore patterns in age, appointment no-shows, and the relationship between waiting time and no-shows. This provides insights into factors influencing appointment attendance.
